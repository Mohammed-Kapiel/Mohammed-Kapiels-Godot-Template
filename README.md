## Godot Template
 
This is a template made for Godot 4.2.1.
It was adapted from my latest game, found here: [https://github.com/Mohammed-Kapiel/Vuno-The-Adventureers-Log]
I will use it internally for all of my games and wanted to share it with you all. 

## Features:
* Main menu setup.
* Setting menu:
	* Music volume slider.
	* Sound effects volume slider.
	* Key input mapping.
	* Language selection dropdown (Needs a localization file, will add an example in a few languages).
	* Resolution dropdown (Only works in windowed mode, will look into making it more universal).
	* Automatically saves choices in a user prefrences file.
* Level manager for switching scenes (Work in progress)
* Audio player (Work in progress)
